## User-Facing Apps & Features

### iOS/iPadOS
- The ability to view and configure Smart Mailboxes in Mail for iOS. (Becky Hansmeyer)
- The ability to schedule a background task for a specific time or interval. (Darren Jones [@venderbase](https://twitter.com/venderbase))
- The ability to back up to an external drive (i.e. Time Machine)
- A method for adding third-party wallpapers that won't clutter up your Photo Library and also supports light/dark mode
- Some degree of widget interactivity, such as the ability to easily start/stop timers, check to-do items, increment a counter, etc.

### watchOS

### macOS
- Widgets should be moved somewhere other than the Notifications panel. (Becky Hansmeyer)

### tvOS

## Developer Tools & Frameworks
- Swift Playground for developing FxPlug 4 extensions to video applications (Alex ‘4D’ Gollner [@alex4D](https://twitter.com/alex4D))

### UIKit

### SwiftUI
- A way to manage First Responder (think TextField focus and tab order)
- Search Bar support or similar in `List`s or `ScrollView`s to add views to the navigation bar that appear with a scroll gesture. ([@JoshHrach](https://twitter.com/JoshHrach))
- Testing framework with support for querying Views and modifiers similar to [ViewInspector](https://github.com/nalexn/ViewInspector)
- Pull-to-refresh
- A way to change the status bar style (light/dark) at runtime using the SwiftUI app life cycle
- Accessory views for TextFields/TextViews
- Inactive/destructive states in Context Menus
- Context menu preview-providers (for showing a custom preview on long-press/right-click)
- SwiftUI version of UIVisualEffectView
- Native support for the share sheet

### Other Apple Frameworks (i.e. AVFoundation, SiriKit, etc.)
- A modern successor to Core Data that plays well with Combine and SwiftUI
- Improved support in NSPersistentCloudKitContainer for scheduling background uploads, improving the reliability of saving to CloudKit when used in an app extension (Josh Hrach)
- AVFoundation to support display and capture of additional video channels beyond Red, Green and Blue: Such as Alpha and Depth (Alex ‘4D’ Gollner)

### Xcode
- Xcode for iPad

### Miscellaneous
- SwiftUI-like simplification of 2D/3D (perhaps building on top of SpriteKit/SceneKit like SwiftUI builds on UIKit) (Josh Hrach)
- Ability to define alternate app icons as App Icon Assets instead of manually including icon images in the project. (Josh Hrach)
- Run custom code in iCloud (similar to lambda functions in AWS)
- CI/CD tools
- Reorganize documentation in a way that reduces duplication of functions that are common between all SwiftUI views
- SwiftUI hot-reloading similar to Flutter (Simulator and on device)
- New flavors of ProRes: ProRes 444D to encode depth maps, ProRes AR to encode detected environment at capture time (Alex ‘4D’ Gollner)

## App Store Policy, Tools, and APIs
- TestFlight for macOS

## Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, or Mixed Reality
- Support ARKit replay data in simulators

## Other
- Improvements to music storage and syncing with Apple Music that will hopefully mean reliable song integrity when dealing with artists with multiple live concerts, especially when uploading song versions not found on Apple Music. (Apple Music currently can't handle this and destroys music libraries as a result.) (Josh Hrach)
